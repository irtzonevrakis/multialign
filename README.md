# multialign.py: A wrapper script for the MDAnalysis structure aligner that supports multiprocessing.

# Requirements

* python >= 3.6
* [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pymp](https://github.com/classner/pymp)

Install everything with:

```
pip install MDAnalysis pymp-pypi numpy
```

# Usage

```
find /path/to/decoys/ -name '*.pdb' > pdb.lst
MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 /path/to/multialign.py --pdblist pdb.lst --outdir /path/to/aligned/decoys
```

Replace `MKL_NUM_THREADS` with `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` if your numpy uses openblas instead. In any case, the script should emit a warning if the environment has not been set up correctly.

The number of threads can be customized using the `--num_threads` parameter. The default, `-1`, will use all available threads, as determined by calling `os.sched_getaffinity(0)`.
